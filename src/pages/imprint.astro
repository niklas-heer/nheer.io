    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p>
      Out of a long tradition of interest and deep love for data protection, we inform you in our
      privacy policy that we do not want to know who you are if you find yourself on this website.
      We also don't want to know how long you stay here, what you look at or even which website
      you visit afterwards.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because your behaviour on our website is none of our business, we do not collect any data
      about your user behaviour and do not record server logs.
    </p>

    <p>
      Data protection always begins and ends with personal data. Because the question when data
      is personal is so important, the European legislator has inserted a legal definition for
      this in Art. 4 Lit.1 GDPR:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      "Personal data" means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural
      person ("data subject"); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified
      directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an
      identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more specific
      characteristics that express the physical, physiological, genetic, psychological, economic,
      cultural or social identity of that natural person.
    </blockquote>
