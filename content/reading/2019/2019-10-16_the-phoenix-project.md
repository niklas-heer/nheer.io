## Review

I really enjoyed reading this book it pulled me in from the first few minutes due to it's novel like narrative.
There were a lot of situations in the book which I can totally relate to.

Although I know about the DevOps movement for quite some time now I didn't know about the book and it's role defining it.
It is a great read and has some great lessons you can learn from it.

For me the most memorable thing was about applying lean principles to IT and software development.
This is a thing I will try to encorporate into my own day to day life.
