## Introduction

This book is the successor of the book "The Phoenix Project" which I blazed through, because it articulated something which I also have experienced in my work life.

`The Unicorn Project` is not different in that regard. It tells the story from another perspective. You don't have to read one before the other, but they are both excellent books!

`The Unicorn Project` is a fictionalized story about a DevOps transformation taking place at the same time as The Phoenix Project. In this novel, Gene Kim introduces the five ideals of Locality and Simplicity; Focus, Flow and Joy; Improvement of Daily Work; Psychological Safety; and Customer Focus.
