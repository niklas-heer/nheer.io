Hi, I am Niklas.

I am an DevOps and Quality Engineer at Tradebyte which means I care for tools, setups and guidance for the developers regarding DevOps topics such as CI, Docker, project templates and Linux. The other part - Quality - is done by having an eye on test-coverage and setting standards to ensure a smooth operation of our applications at work.
