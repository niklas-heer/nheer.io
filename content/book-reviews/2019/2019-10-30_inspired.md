## Review

This book contains a great deal of specific pointers on how to develop engaging products and how to best create a product-oriented culture.

## Key lessons

The author describes three overarching principles which help overcome root causes of failed product efforts:

1. Risks are tackled upfront, instead of at the end
2. Products are defined and designed collaboratively, rather than sequentially
3. Finally, it’s all about solving problems, not implementing features

“Continuous Discovery and Delivery” is a great way to translate these three principles into a process and mindset for people to adhere too.

{{< quote "It doesn’t matter how good your engineering team is if they are not given something worthwhile to build." >}}

{{< quote "Software projects can be thought of as having two distinct stages: figuring out what to build (build the right product), and building it (building the product right). The first stage is dominated by product discovery, and the second stage is all about execution." >}}

{{< quote "Never tell people how to do things. Tell them what to do, and they will surprise you with their ingenuity" "General George S. Patton" >}}
