{{< figure src="nheer_logo.png" position="center" style="max-height: 300px;" >}}

This is my new logo which I mainly made as a `favicon` for this site.

## How I came up with it

Actually it was a pretty quick prototyping and I kind of like the result. It is not perfect, but better than my old logo which looked like this:

{{< figure src="2019/2019-12-28_old-logo.png" position="center" style="height: 200px;" >}}

What I actually did to make the new logo happen is that I used [Gravit Designer](https://designer.gravit.io) and opened a new **512** by **512** pixel document. Then I started with a circle in a color I like (`#9900FF`). After that I just wrote an `N` in a text element and went through the different fonts. The font I finally landed on was `Bungee Shade`. I centered it and then I converted the font to path.

{{< figure src="2019/2019-12-28_screenshot-6.png" position="center" >}}

After that I had a compounded path which I split it up.

Then I just reordered the paths, grouped them and changed the color of the inner shape to white. That was it.

Then the only thing left to do was export it as a `png` and upload it to [realfavicongenerator.net](https://realfavicongenerator.net) to generate all the necessary files for use as a `favicon`.

## Conclusion

I think **[Gravit Designer](https://designer.gravit.io)** is a really fine tool to do stuff like that. I even got a subscription for the service which is way cheaper than Photoshop or something like it and I can use it on `Linux` and `macOS`!

Cheers :beers:
