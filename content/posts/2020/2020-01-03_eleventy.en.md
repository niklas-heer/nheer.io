## Backstory

In [another post]({{< ref "2019-12-30_strapdown-zeta.en.md" >}}) I talked about Strapdown as a solution to create webpages quickly using Markdown. But this solutions has [some caveats]({{< ref "2019-12-30_strapdown-zeta.en.md#caveats" >}}) as I also mentioned.

This post is about [eleventy](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy) which doesn't have the caveats mentioned but needs a little more work.

## Why you should choose `eleventy`

### Pros

These are the main benefits compared to [**Strapdown**](http://strapdown.ztx.io/) and [**Hugo**](https://gohugo.io/):

- very simple setup compared to [hugo]
- is still in active development compared to [strapdown]
- has no mixed content issue like [strapdown]
- you can bring your own style compared to [strapdown]
- works with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

### Cons

These are the downsides:

- not as powerful as [hugo]
- not as fast to setup as [strapdown]

## How to use it

Enough talking now let us get into it.

Basically you can follow the [getting started guide](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/getting-started/).

### Installation

First we need to create a `package.json` in our directory:

```bash
npm init -y
```

After that change the `"scripts":` section in your `package.json` to add the needed script runs we need for Netlify:

```json
"scripts": {
    "build": "npx eleventy",
    "watch": "npx eleventy --watch",
    "dev": "npm run watch"
},
```

Now we need to install Eleventy into our project’s `package.json` by running:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @11ty/eleventy
```

### Setting up everything

You could start plain with files in the root directory, but since Eleventy will compile everything, I like some basic structure.
I will show you how I built the [redblock.de site](https://site.redblock.de) with [hack.css](https://hackcss.egoist.moe/).

#### Add Eleventy configuration

`.eleventy.js`

```js
module.exports = function(eleventyConfig) {
  eleventyConfig.addPassthroughCopy("src/scripts");

  return {
    dir: { input: "src", output: "dist", data: "_data" },
    passthroughFileCopy: true,
    templateFormats: ["njk", "md", "css", "html", "yml"],
    htmlTemplateEngine: "njk"
  };
};
```

This configuration specifies that we will but everything in a `src` directory so we need to create the folder and some others we will use later:

```plain
.
└── src
    ├── _includes
    ├── scripts
    └── styles
```

All the generated files will go to the `dist` directory in your root folder.

#### We need to ignore some stuff to stay sane

Add these files in your root directory:

`.gitignore`

```ini
# Dependency directories
node_modules/

# eleventy.js build output
dist
```

`.eleventyignore`

```ini
README.md
```

#### Adding a template

Now we can add the base template for which I use Nunjucks. Which we do like this:

`src/_includes/hack.njk`

```go-html-template
---
title: RedBlock Homepage
---
<!doctype html>
<html lang="de">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/styles/hack.css">
		<link rel="stylesheet" href="/styles/solarized-dark.css">
		<link rel="stylesheet" href="/styles/dark-grey.css">
		<link rel="stylesheet" href="/styles/prism.css">
    <title>{{ title }}</title>
  </head>
  <body class="hack dark-grey">
    <div class="main container">
      {{ content | safe }}
    </div>
    <script src="/scripts/prism.js" async=""></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

You can read more about how templates work and which options you have in [the docs](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/templates/).

Now you can add the assets yourself. You can find the files [here](https://github.com/niklas-heer/redblock/tree/master/src). This is what the whole thing should look like:

```plain
.
└── src
    ├── _includes
    │   └── hack.njk
    ├── scripts
    │   └── prism.js
    └── styles
        ├── dark-grey.css
        ├── hack.css
        ├── prism.css
        └── solarized-dark.css
```

### Putting everything together

Okay so now everything is ready and we can build our site. Now you can create your main file like this:

`src/index.md`

```mdk
---
layout: hack.njk
---

# Hello World from Eleventy!
```

Now you can have a look how the site looks with `npx @11ty/eleventy --serve` or `netlify dev`.

{{< figure src="2020/2020-01-04_screenshot-1.png" >}}

This is how your directory should look now:

```bash
tree -I 'node_modules|.git' -a -L 3
.
├── .eleventy.js
├── .eleventyignore
├── .gitignore
├── README.md
├── dist
│   └── ...
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
└── src
    ├── _includes
    │   └── hack.njk
    ├── index.md
    ├── scripts
    │   └── prism.js
    └── styles
        ├── dark-grey.css
        ├── hack.css
        ├── prism.css
        └── solarized-dark.css
```

This is how your [Netlify](https://netlify.com) `Build & Deploy` settings should look like:

## Conclusion

I really like this solution, because as said it resolves some issues I had with Strapdown. Also it is expandable. :thumbsup: <br />
If you want to look at an example you can view the source of [the site I used it for](https://github.com/niklas-heer/redblock).
You can also have a look at [this boilerplate repo](https://github.com/ianrose/deventy).

I hope this tutorial helps someone, cheers! :tada:
